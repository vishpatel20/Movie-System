# Movie-System

Welcome!!!

This is a movie selector program I made to test out the features of C++. I wanted to see if I can use my knowledge I have learned in class and implemented
everything I learned.

Program: Movie System
Purpose: This program will allow a user to select movie tickets, update ticket prices, view seats and purchase tickets. Its really simple program using only
1 cpp file but it can be modified to be much better using a few separate files. Hopefully you enjoy what I have posted!
